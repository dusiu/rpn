##Reverse Polish Notation project
After cloning project create jar with dependencies using maven clean package

When build is finished go to target folder and start application with parameters ie.:
```
java -jar reversePolishNotation.jar 4 2 -

Or if you can start jar without arguments they will be read from console log:
